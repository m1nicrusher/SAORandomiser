# SAORandomiser
Help You Decide! --Lightweight Randomly Selection Tool
Description
-----
This app is HTML/CSS/JavaScript based so it has the potential to port on any devices (will be in the future).

Usage
-----
Just pop index.html into any of modern browsers. Hit that happy little red button and wait for 8 senconds for the result.

Configuration
-----
Note that this app is still in the earliest/alpha/test version so it is not configurable (but will be in the near future).

About This Project
-----
This is my first HTML/CSS/JavaScript practice project.  
The first alpha version was written with only 2 days of JavaScript learning so don't expect this to be a perfect piece of work.  
The previous version of SAO Randomiser was written in C# and this is (should be) an improved project.
